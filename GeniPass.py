""" In our daily lives, we frequently rely on passwords to protect our most sensitive information, like email and bank
account details. The use of secure passwords is necessary in shielding us from unauthorized access and potential
fraudulent activities that could jeopardize our security. A weak password is one that can be easily guessed due to its
simplicity. Such passwords often consist of common words, basic phrases, or predictable sequences such as "password,"
"123456," and lack a diverse mix of characters.

Recognizing the need for stronger password security, we have envisioned Geni-Pass, a secure password generator. This
program is designed to allow users with the ability to tailor their passwords' length and strength according to their
wants and needs. Geni-Pass offers the option to include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special
characters. These elements are randomly combined to ensure the generation of a strong password. For instance, if you
require a password incorporating uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters, Geni-Pass will integrate these
elements, producing a strong and reliable password. Our goal with Geni-Pass is to make the creation of secure passwords straightforward and reliable.

    2. Number of passwords to generate: Allows generation of multiple passwords.
    3. Types of characters to include (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols): 
       User can specify a combination of character types for the password.

    The function then iterates to create the specified number of passwords. For each password, it 
    iterates over its length, filling each position with a randomly chosen character from the 
    specified types. The process includes validation of inputs and handling of invalid selections.

    Outputs:
    Each generated password is printed out once it is created.
